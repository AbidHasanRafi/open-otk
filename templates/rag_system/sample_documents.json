        "text": "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. It supports multiple programming paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.",

        "text": "Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. The process of learning begins with observations or data to look for patterns and make better decisions in the future.",

        "text": "Neural networks are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information. Each connection can transmit a signal from one neuron to another. The receiving neuron processes the signal and signals downstream neurons connected to it.",

        "text": "RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) is a technique that combines information retrieval with text generation. It works by first retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge base, then using those documents as context for generating responses. This approach helps reduce hallucinations and provides more accurate, grounded responses.",
